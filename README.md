🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture 🌾
📌 Overview
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered solution that utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect plant diseases early and accurately. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can identify diseases and provide actionable insights to farmers, enabling them to take timely measures to prevent crop loss.

This project aims to promote sustainable agriculture by:
✅ Reducing crop losses through early disease detection
✅ Enhancing farm productivity with real-time diagnosis
✅ Supporting farmers with automated and actionable insights

🚀 Features
Real-time Disease Detection – Identify plant diseases from leaf images

Deep Learning & Computer Vision – Uses CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for accurate classification

User-Friendly Interface – Simple and intuitive UI for farmers and researchers

Sustainable Approach – Helps minimize pesticide overuse by targeting affected areas

Scalable & Extendable – Supports multiple plant species and diseases

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 🐍

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch

Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Dataset: PlantVillage / Custom Labeled Dataset

Frontend: Streamlit / Flask (for web-based interface)

Backend: FastAPI / Flask

Deployment: Docker, AWS / Google Cloud / Azure

📸 How It Works
📷 Upload an Image – The user uploads a picture of a plant leaf.

🧠 Model Prediction – The AI model analyzes the image and predicts the disease.

📊 Results & Suggestions – The system provides the disease name and possible solutions.

🌾 Sustainable Actions – Farmers can take necessary actions based on recommendations.

📊 Dataset
We use the PlantVillage dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented to improve model accuracy.

📌 Supported Crops & Diseases
✔ Tomato – Early Blight, Late Blight, Septoria Leaf Spot
✔ Potato – Late Blight
✔ Apple – Apple Scab, Black Rot
✔ Grape – Black Rot, Leaf Blight
(And more...)

🎯 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve model accuracy with more diverse datasets
🔹 Add multilingual support for farmers worldwide 🌍
🔹 Develop a mobile app for on-the-go disease detection 📱
🔹 Implement IoT integration for real-time field monitoring
